# Secret Message Encoder & Decoder

This Python script encodes and decodes messages into a secret language using a simple transformation method.

## Features
- **Encoding:** Scrambles text with word reversal and random characters.
- **Decoding:** Restores the original message.
- **Simple & Fun:** A lightweight tool for text transformation.

## How It Works
1. Takes input from the user.
2. If a word has **2 or fewer characters**, it reverses it.
3. If a word has **more than 2 characters**, it:
   - Reverses all but the last character.
   - Adds three random letters at the start and end.
4. Decoding reverses the process.

## Installation & Usage
